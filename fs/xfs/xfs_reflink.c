/*
 * Copy on Write of Shared Blocks
 *
 * XFS must preserve "the usual" file semantics even when two files share
 * the same physical blocks.  This means that a write to one file must not
 * alter the blocks in a different file; the way that we'll do that is
 * through the use of a copy-on-write mechanism.  At a high level, that
 * means that when we want to write to a shared block, we allocate a new
 * block, write the data to the new block, and if that succeeds we map the
 * new block into the file.
 *
 * XFS provides a "delayed allocation" mechanism that defers the allocation
 * of disk blocks to dirty-but-not-yet-mapped file blocks as long as
 * possible.  This reduces fragmentation by enabling the filesystem to ask
 * for bigger chunks less often, which is exactly what we want for CoW.
 *
 * The delalloc mechanism begins when the kernel wants to make a block
 * writable (write_begin or page_mkwrite).  If the offset is not mapped, we
 * create a delalloc mapping, which is a regular in-core extent, but without
 * a real startblock.  (For delalloc mappings, the startblock encodes both
 * a flag that this is a delalloc mapping, and a worst-case estimate of how
 * many blocks might be required to put the mapping into the BMBT.)  delalloc
 * mappings are a reservation against the free space in the filesystem;
 * adjacent mappings can also be combined into fewer larger mappings.
 *
 * When dirty pages are being written out (typically in writepage), the
 * delalloc reservations are converted into real mappings by allocating
 * blocks and replacing the delalloc mapping with real ones.  A delalloc
 * mapping can be replaced by several real ones if the free space is
 * fragmented.
 *
 * We want to adapt the delalloc mechanism for copy-on-write, since the
 * write paths are similar.  The first two steps (creating the reservation
 * and allocating the blocks) are exactly the same as delalloc except that
 * the mappings must be stored in a separate CoW fork because we do not want
 * to disturb the mapping in the data fork until we're sure that the write
 * succeeded.  IO completion in this case is the process of removing the old
 * mapping from the data fork and moving the new mapping from the CoW fork to
 * the data fork.  This will be discussed shortly.
 *
 * For now, unaligned directio writes will be bounced back to the page cache.
 * Block-aligned directio writes will use the same mechanism as buffered
 * writes.
 *
 * CoW remapping must be done after the data block write completes,
 * because we don't want to destroy the old data fork map until we're sure
 * the new block has been written.  Since the new mappings are kept in a
 * separate fork, we can simply iterate these mappings to find the ones
 * that cover the file blocks that we just CoW'd.  For each extent, simply
 * unmap the corresponding range in the data fork, map the new range into
 * the data fork, and remove the extent from the CoW fork.
 *
 * Since the remapping operation can be applied to an arbitrary file
 * range, we record the need for the remap step as a flag in the ioend
 * instead of declaring a new IO type.  This is required for direct io
 * because we only have ioend for the whole dio, and we have to be able to
 * remember the presence of unwritten blocks and CoW blocks with a single
 * ioend structure.  Better yet, the more ground we can cover with one
 * ioend, the better.
