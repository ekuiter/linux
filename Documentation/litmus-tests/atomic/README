This directory contains litmus tests that are typical to describe the semantics
of our atomic APIs. For more information about how to "run" a litmus test or
how to generate a kernel test module based on a litmus test, please see
tools/memory-model/README.

============
LITMUS TESTS
============

Atomic-RMW+mb__after_atomic-is-stronger-than-acquire
	Test that an atomic RMW followed by a smp_mb__after_atomic() is
	stronger than a normal acquire: both the read and write parts of
	the RMW are ordered before the subsequential memory accesses.

Atomic-RMW-ops-are-atomic-WRT-atomic_set.litmus
	Test that atomic_set() cannot break the atomicity of atomic RMWs.
