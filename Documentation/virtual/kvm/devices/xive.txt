POWER9 eXternal Interrupt Virtualization Engine (XIVE Gen1)
==========================================================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_XIVE     POWER9 XIVE Interrupt Controller generation 1

This device acts as a VM interrupt controller. It provides the KVM
interface to configure the interrupt sources of a VM in the underlying
POWER9 XIVE interrupt controller.

Only one XIVE instance may be instantiated. A guest XIVE device
requires a POWER9 host and the guest OS should have support for the
XIVE native exploitation interrupt mode. If not, it should run using
the legacy interrupt mode, referred as XICS (POWER7/8).

* Groups:

  1. KVM_DEV_XIVE_GRP_CTRL
  Provides global controls on the device
