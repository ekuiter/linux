ARM Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller (VGIC)
===============================================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2     ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v2.0

Only one VGIC instance may be instantiated through either this API or the
legacy KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP api.  The created VGIC will act as the VM interrupt
controller, requiring emulated user-space devices to inject interrupts to the
VGIC instead of directly to CPUs.

Groups:
  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR
  Attributes:
    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_DIST (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC distributor
      register mappings.

    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_CPU (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC virtual cpu
      interface register mappings.
