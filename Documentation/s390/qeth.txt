HiperSockets Bridge Port Support

Uevents

To generate the events the device must be assigned a role of either
a primary or a secondary Bridge Port. For more information, see
"z/VM Connectivity, SC24-6174".

When run on HiperSockets Bridge Capable Port hardware, and the state
of some configured Bridge Port device on the channel changes, a udev
event with ACTION=CHANGE is emitted on behalf of the corresponding
ccwgroup device. The event has the following attributes:

BRIDGEPORT=statechange -  indicates that the Bridge Port device changed
  its state.

ROLE={primary|secondary|none} - the role assigned to the port.

STATE={active|standby|inactive} - the newly assumed state of the port.
