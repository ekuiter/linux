Bare UDP Tunnelling Module Documentation
========================================

There are various L3 encapsulation standards using UDP being discussed to
leverage the UDP based load balancing capability of different networks.
MPLSoUDP (__ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7510) is one among them.

The Bareudp tunnel module provides a generic L3 encapsulation tunnelling
support for tunnelling different L3 protocols like MPLS, IP, NSH etc. inside
a UDP tunnel.

Usage
------

1) Device creation & deletion

    a) ip link add dev bareudp0 type bareudp dstport 6635 ethertype 0x8847.

       This creates a bareudp tunnel device which tunnels L3 traffic with ethertype
       0x8847 (MPLS traffic). The destination port of the UDP header will be set to
       6635.The device will listen on UDP port 6635 to receive traffic.

    b) ip link delete bareudp0

2) Device Usage

The bareudp device could be used along with OVS or flower filter in TC.
The OVS or TC flower layer must set the tunnel information in SKB dst field before
sending packet buffer to the bareudp device for transmission. On reception the
bareudp device extracts and stores the tunnel information in SKB dst field before
passing the packet buffer to the network stack.
