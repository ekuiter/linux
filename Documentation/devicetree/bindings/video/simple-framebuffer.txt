Simple Framebuffer

A simple frame-buffer describes a frame-buffer setup by firmware or
the bootloader, with the assumption that the display hardware has already
been set up to scan out from the memory pointed to by the reg property.

Required properties:
- compatible: "simple-framebuffer"
- reg: Should contain the location and size of the framebuffer memory.
- width: The width of the framebuffer in pixels.
- height: The height of the framebuffer in pixels.
- stride: The number of bytes in each line of the framebuffer.
- format: The format of the framebuffer surface. Valid values are:
  - r5g6b5 (16-bit pixels, d[15:11]=r, d[10:5]=g, d[4:0]=b).
  - a8b8g8r8 (32-bit pixels, d[31:24]=a, d[23:16]=b, d[15:8]=g, d[7:0]=r).

Optional properties:
- clocks : List of clocks used by the framebuffer. Clocks listed here
           are expected to already be configured correctly. The OS must
           ensure these clocks are not modified or disabled while the
           simple framebuffer remains active.

Example:

	framebuffer {
		compatible = "simple-framebuffer";
		reg = <0x1d385000 (1600 * 1200 * 2)>;
		width = <1600>;
		height = <1200>;
		stride = <(1600 * 2)>;
		format = "r5g6b5";
	};
