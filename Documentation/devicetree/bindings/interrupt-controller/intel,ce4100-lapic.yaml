title: Intel Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC)

description: |
  Intel's Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is a
  family of interrupt controllers. The APIC is a split
  architecture design, with a local component (LAPIC) integrated
  into the processor itself and an external I/O APIC. Local APIC
  (lapic) receives interrupts from the processor's interrupt pins,
  from internal sources and from an external I/O APIC (ioapic).
  And it sends these to the processor core for handling.
  See [1] Chapter 8 for more details.

  Many of the Intel's generic devices like hpet, ioapic, lapic have
  the ce4100 name in their compatible property names because they
  first appeared in CE4100 SoC.

  This schema defines bindings for local APIC interrupt controller.
