Device tree configuration for i2c-ocores

Required properties:
- compatible      : "opencores,i2c-ocores"
- reg             : bus address start and address range size of device
- interrupts      : interrupt number
- regstep         : size of device registers in bytes
- clock-frequency : frequency of bus clock in Hz
- #address-cells  : should be <1>
- #size-cells     : should be <0>

Example:

	i2c0: ocores@a0000000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "opencores,i2c-ocores";
		reg = <0xa0000000 0x8>;
		interrupts = <10>;
		regstep = <1>;
		clock-frequency = <20000000>;

		dummy@60 {
			compatible = "dummy";
			reg = <0x60>;
		};
	};
