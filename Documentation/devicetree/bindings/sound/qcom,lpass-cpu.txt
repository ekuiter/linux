* Qualcomm Technologies LPASS CPU DAI

This node models the Qualcomm Technologies Low-Power Audio SubSystem (LPASS).

Required properties:

- compatible		: "qcom,lpass-cpu" or "qcom,apq8016-lpass-cpu" or
			  "qcom,sc7180-lpass-cpu"
- clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "ahbix-clk"
				* "mi2s-osr-clk"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk"
			: required clocks for "qcom,lpass-cpu-apq8016"
				* "ahbix-clk"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk0"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk1"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk2"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk3"
				* "pcnoc-mport-clk"
				* "pcnoc-sway-clk"
			: required clocks for "qcom,lpass-cpu-sc7180"
				* "audio-core"
				* "mclk0"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk0"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk1"
				* "pcnoc-sway-clk"
				* "pcnoc-mport-clk"

- interrupts		: Must contain an entry for each entry in
			  interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names	: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-irq-lpaif"
- pinctrl-N		: One property must exist for each entry in
			  pinctrl-names.  See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
			  for details of the property values.
- pinctrl-names		: Must contain a "default" entry.
- reg			: Must contain an address for each entry in reg-names.
- reg-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-lpaif"
- #address-cells	: Must be 1
- #size-cells		: Must be 0



Optional properties:

- qcom,adsp		: Phandle for the audio DSP node

By default, the driver uses up to 4 MI2S SD lines, for a total of 8 channels.
The SD lines to use can be configured by adding subnodes for each of the DAIs.

Required properties for each DAI (represented by a subnode):
- reg			: Must be one of the DAI IDs
			  (usually part of dt-bindings header)
- qcom,playback-sd-lines: List of serial data lines to use for playback
			  Each SD line should be represented by a number from 0-3.
- qcom,capture-sd-lines	: List of serial data lines to use for capture
			  Each SD line should be represented by a number from 0-3.

Note that adding a subnode changes the default to "no lines configured",
so both playback and capture lines should be configured when a subnode is added.
