Analog Devices ADAU1701

Required properties:

 - compatible:		Should contain "adi,adau1701"
 - reg:			The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
			and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Optional properties:

 - reset-gpio: 		A GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the
			chip's !RESET pin. If specified, the driver will
			assert a hardware reset at probe time.
 - adi,pll-mode-gpios:	An array of two GPIO specs to describe the GPIOs
			the ADAU's PLL config pins are connected to.
			The state of the pins are set according to the
			configured clock divider on ASoC side before the
			firmware is loaded.

Examples:

	i2c_bus {
		adau1701@34 {
			compatible = "adi,adau1701";
			reg = <0x34>;
			reset-gpio = <&gpio 23 0>;
			adi,pll-mode-gpios = <&gpio 24 0 &gpio 25 0>;
		};
	};
