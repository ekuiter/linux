Cirrus Logic Arizona class audio SoCs

These devices are audio SoCs with extensive digital capabilities and a range
of analogue I/O.

This document lists Extcon specific bindings, see the primary binding document:
  ../mfd/arizona.txt

Optional properties:

  - wlf,hpdet-channel : Headphone detection channel.
    ARIZONA_ACCDET_MODE_HPL or 1 - Headphone detect mode is set to HPDETL
    ARIZONA_ACCDET_MODE_HPR or 2 - Headphone detect mode is set to HPDETR
    If this node is not mentioned or if the value is unknown, then
    headphone detection mode is set to HPDETL.

  - wlf,use-jd-gpio : Use GPIO input along with JD1 for dual pin jack
    detection.
  - wlf,use-jd-gpio-nopull : Internal pull on GPIO is disabled when used for
    jack detection.
  - wlf,jd-invert : Invert the polarity of the jack detection switch

  - wlf,micd-software-compare : Use a software comparison to determine mic
    presence
  - wlf,micd-detect-debounce : Additional software microphone detection
    debounce specified in milliseconds.
  - wlf,micd-pol-gpio : GPIO specifier for the GPIO controlling the headset
    polarity if one exists.
  - wlf,micd-bias-start-time : Time allowed for MICBIAS to startup prior to
    performing microphone detection, specified as per the ARIZONA_MICD_TIME_XXX
    defines.
  - wlf,micd-rate : Delay between successive microphone detection measurements,
    specified as per the ARIZONA_MICD_TIME_XXX defines.
  - wlf,micd-dbtime : Microphone detection hardware debounces specified as the
    number of measurements to take, valid values being 2 and 4.
  - wlf,micd-timeout : Timeout for microphone detection, specified in
    milliseconds.
  - wlf,micd-force-micbias : Force MICBIAS continuously on during microphone
    detection.

  - wlf,gpsw : Settings for the general purpose switch
