* Freescale i.MX AHCI SATA Controller

The Freescale i.MX SATA controller mostly conforms to the AHCI interface
with some special extensions at integration level.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of the following:
   - "fsl,imx53-ahci" for i.MX53 SATA controller
   - "fsl,imx6q-ahci" for i.MX6Q SATA controller
- interrupts : interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ
- reg : registers mapping
- clocks : list of clock specifiers, must contain an entry for each
  required entry in clock-names
- clock-names : should include "sata", "sata_ref" and "ahb" entries

Examples:

sata@02200000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ahci";
	reg = <0x02200000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_SATA>,
		 <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_SATA_REF_100M>,
		 <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_AHB>;
	clock-names = "sata", "sata_ref", "ahb";
};
