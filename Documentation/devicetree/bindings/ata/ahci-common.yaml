description:
  This document defines device tree properties for a common AHCI SATA
  controller implementation. It's hardware interface is supposed to
  conform to the technical standard defined by Intel (see Serial ATA
  Advanced Host Controller Interface specification for details). The
  document doesn't constitute a DT-node binding by itself but merely
  defines a set of common properties for the AHCI-compatible devices.

      Generic AHCI state change interrupt. Can be implemented either as a
      single line attached to the controller or as a set of the signals
      indicating the particular port events.
