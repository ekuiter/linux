NVIDIA Tegra Power Management Controller (PMC)

Required properties:
- name : Should be pmc
- compatible : Should contain "nvidia,tegra<chip>-pmc".
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  "pclk" (The Tegra clock of that name),
  "clk32k_in" (The 32KHz clock input to Tegra).

Optional properties:
- nvidia,invert-interrupt : If present, inverts the PMU interrupt signal.
  The PMU is an external Power Management Unit, whose interrupt output
  signal is fed into the PMC. This signal is optionally inverted, and then
  fed into the ARM GIC. The PMC is not involved in the detection or
  handling of this interrupt signal, merely its inversion.

Example:

/ SoC dts including file
pmc@7000f400 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-pmc";
	reg = <0x7000e400 0x400>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car 110>, <&clk32k_in>;
	clock-names = "pclk", "clk32k_in";
	nvidia,invert-interrupt;
};

/ Tegra board dts file
{
	...
	clocks {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		clk32k_in: clock {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			reg=<0>;
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <32768>;
		};
	};
	...
};
