Hisilicon Hi6220 system controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "hisilicon,hi6220-sysctrl"
- reg : Register address and size
- #clock-cells: should be set to 1, many clock registers are defined
  under this controller and this property must be present.

Hisilicon designs this controller as one of the system controllers,
its main functions are the same as Hisilicon system controller, but
the register offset of some core modules are different.

Example:
	/*for Hi6220*/
	sys_ctrl: sys_ctrl@f7030000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-sysctrl", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0 0xf7030000 0x0 0x2000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
