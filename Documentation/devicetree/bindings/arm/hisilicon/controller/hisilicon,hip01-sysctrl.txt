Hisilicon HiP01 system controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "hisilicon,hip01-sysctrl"
- reg : Register address and size

The HiP01 system controller is mostly compatible with hisilicon
system controller,but it has some specific control registers for
HIP01 SoC family, such as slave core boot, and also some same
registers located at different offset.

Example:

	/* for hip01-ca9x2 */
	sysctrl: system-controller@10000000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip01-sysctrl", "hisilicon,sysctrl";
		reg = <0x10000000 0x1000>;
		reboot-offset = <0x4>;
	};
