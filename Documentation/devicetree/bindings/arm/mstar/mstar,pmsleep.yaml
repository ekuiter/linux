description: |
  MStar/Sigmastar's Armv7 SoCs contain a region of registers that are
  in the always on domain that the vendor code calls the "pmsleep" area.

  This area contains registers and bits for a broad range of functionality
  ranging from registers that control going into deep sleep to bits that
  turn things like the internal temperature sensor on and off.
