Broadcom BCM63138 DSL System-on-a-Chip device tree bindings
-----------------------------------------------------------

Boards compatible with the BCM63138 DSL System-on-a-Chip should have the
following properties:

Required root node property:

compatible: should be "brcm,bcm63138"

An optional Boot lookup table Device Tree node is required for secondary CPU
initialization as well as a 'resets' phandle to the correct PMB controller as
defined in reset/brcm,bcm63138-pmb.txt for this secondary CPU, and an
'enable-method' property.

Required properties for the Boot lookup table node:
- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm63138-bootlut"
- reg: register base address and length for the Boot Lookup table

Optional properties for the primary CPU node:
- enable-method: should be "brcm,bcm63138"

Optional properties for the secondary CPU node:
- enable-method: should be "brcm,bcm63138"
- resets: phandle to the relevant PMB controller, one integer indicating the internal
  bus number, and a second integer indicating the address of the CPU in the PMB
  internal bus number.

Example:

	cpus {
		cpu@0 {
			compatible = "arm,cotex-a9";
			reg = <0>;
			...
			enable-method = "brcm,bcm63138";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <1>;
			...
			enable-method = "brcm,bcm63138";
			resets = <&pmb0 4 1>;
		};
	};

	bootlut: bootlut@8000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm63138-bootlut";
		reg = <0x8000 0x50>;
	};
