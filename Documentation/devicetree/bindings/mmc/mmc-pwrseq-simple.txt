* The simple MMC power sequence provider

The purpose of the simple MMC power sequence provider is to supports a set of
common properties between various SOC designs. It thus enables us to use the
same provider for several SOC designs.

Required properties:
- compatible : contains "mmc-pwrseq-simple".

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios : contains a GPIO specifier. The reset GPIO is asserted at
	initialization and prior we start the power up procedure of the card. It
	will be de-asserted right after the power has been provided to the card.

Example:

	sdhci0_pwrseq {
		compatible = "mmc-pwrseq-simple";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 12 0>;
	}
