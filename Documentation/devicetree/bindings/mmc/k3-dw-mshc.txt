* Hisilicon specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Read synopsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi4511 specific extentions.

* clock-freq-table: should be the frequency (in Hz) array of the ciu clock
	in each	supported mode.
	0. CIU clock rate in Hz for DS mode
	1. CIU clock rate in Hz for MMC HS mode
	2. CIU clock rate in Hz for SD HS mode
	3. CIU clock rate in Hz for SDR12 mode
	4. CIU clock rate in Hz for SDR25 mode
	5. CIU clock rate in Hz for SDR50 mode
	6. CIU clock rate in Hz for SDR104 mode
	7. CIU clock rate in Hz for DDR50 mode
	8. CIU clock rate in Hz for HS200 mode

Example:

	/* for Hi3620 */

	/* SoC portion */
	dwmmc_0: dwmmc0@fcd03000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0xfcd03000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 16 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&mmc_clock HI3620_SD_CIUCLK>, <&clock HI3620_DDRC_PER_CLK>;
		clock-names = "ciu", "biu";
		clock-freq-table =
		<25000000 0 50000000 25000000 50000000 100000000 0 50000000>;
	};

	/* Board portion */
	dwmmc0@fcd03000 {
		num-slots = <1>;
		vmmc-supply = <&ldo12>;
		fifo-depth = <0x100>;
		supports-highspeed;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sd_pmx_pins &sd_cfg_func1 &sd_cfg_func2>;
		slot@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			bus-width = <4>;
			disable-wp;
			cd-gpios = <&gpio10 3 0>;
		};
	};
