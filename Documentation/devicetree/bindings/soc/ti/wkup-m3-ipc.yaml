description: |+
  The TI AM33xx and AM43xx family of devices use a small Cortex M3 co-processor
  (commonly referred to as Wakeup M3 or CM3) to help with various low power tasks
  that cannot be controlled from the MPU, like suspend/resume and certain deep
  C-states for CPU Idle. Once the wkup_m3_ipc driver uses the wkup_m3_rproc driver
  to boot the wkup_m3, it handles communication with the CM3 using IPC registers
  present in the SoC's control module and a mailbox. The wkup_m3_ipc exposes an
  API to allow the SoC PM code to execute specific PM tasks.

  Wkup M3 Device Node
  ====================
  A wkup_m3_ipc device node is used to represent the IPC registers within an
  SoC.
