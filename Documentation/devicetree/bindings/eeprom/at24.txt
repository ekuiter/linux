EEPROMs (I2C)

Required properties:

  - compatible: Must be a "<manufacturer>,<model>" pair. The following <model>
                values are supported (assuming "atmel" as manufacturer):

                "atmel,24c00",
                "atmel,24c01",
                "atmel,24c02",
                "atmel,spd",
                "atmel,24c04",
                "atmel,24c08",
                "atmel,24c16",
                "atmel,24c32",
                "atmel,24c64",
                "atmel,24c128",
                "atmel,24c256",
                "atmel,24c512",
                "atmel,24c1024",

                If <manufacturer> is not "atmel", then a fallback must be used
                with the same <model> and "atmel" as manufacturer.

                Example:
                        compatible = "microchip,24c128", "atmel,24c128";

                Supported manufacturers are:

                "catalyst",
                "microchip",
                "ramtron",
                "renesas",
                "nxp",
                "st",

                Some vendors use different model names for chips which are just
                variants of the above. Known such exceptions are listed below:

                "renesas,r1ex24002" - the fallback is "atmel,24c02"

  - reg : the I2C address of the EEPROM

Optional properties:

  - pagesize : the length of the pagesize for writing. Please consult the
               manual of your device, that value varies a lot. A wrong value
	       may result in data loss! If not specified, a safety value of
	       '1' is used which will be very slow.

  - read-only: this parameterless property disables writes to the eeprom

  - size: total eeprom size in bytes

  - no-read-rollover:
			This parameterless property indicates that the multi-address
			eeprom does not automatically roll over reads to the next
			slave address. Please consult the manual of your device.

  - wp-gpios: GPIO to which the write-protect pin of the chip is connected.

Example:

eeprom@52 {
	compatible = "atmel,24c32";
	reg = <0x52>;
	pagesize = <32>;
	wp-gpios = <&gpio1 3 0>;
};
