description:
  This document lists a set of generic properties for describing UARTs in a
  device tree.  Whether these properties apply to a particular device depends
  on the DT bindings for the actual device.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^serial(@.*)?$"

  cts-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's CTS line.

  dcd-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's DCD line.

  dsr-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's DSR line.

  dtr-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's DTR line.

  rng-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's RNG line.

  rts-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be used as
      the UART's RTS line.

  uart-has-rtscts:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description:
      The presence of this property indicates that the UART has dedicated lines
      for RTS/CTS hardware flow control, and that they are available for use
      (wired and enabled by pinmux configuration).  This depends on both the
      UART hardware and the board wiring.

if:
  required:
    - uart-has-rtscts
then:
  properties:
    cts-gpios: false
    rts-gpios: false
