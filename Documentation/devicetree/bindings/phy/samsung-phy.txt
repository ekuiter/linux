Samsung SATA PHY Controller
---------------------------

SATA PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip SATA Physical layer controllers.
Each SATA PHY controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "samsung,exynos5250-sata-phy"
- reg : offset and length of the SATA PHY register set;
- #phy-cells : must be zero
- clocks : must be exactly one entry
- clock-names : must be "sata_phyctrl"
- samsung,exynos-sataphy-i2c-phandle : a phandle to the I2C device, no arguments
- samsung,syscon-phandle : a phandle to the PMU system controller, no arguments

Example:
	sata_phy: sata-phy@12170000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-sata-phy";
		reg = <0x12170000 0x1ff>;
		clocks = <&clock 287>;
		clock-names = "sata_phyctrl";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		samsung,exynos-sataphy-i2c-phandle = <&sata_phy_i2c>;
		samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_syscon>;
	};

Device-Tree bindings for sataphy i2c client driver
--------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
compatible: Should be "samsung,exynos-sataphy-i2c"
- reg: I2C address of the sataphy i2c device.

Example:

	sata_phy_i2c:sata-phy@38 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos-sataphy-i2c";
		reg = <0x38>;
	};

Samsung Exynos5 SoC series USB DRD PHY controller
--------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be set to one of the following supported values:
	- "samsung,exynos5250-usbdrd-phy" - for exynos5250 SoC,
	- "samsung,exynos5420-usbdrd-phy" - for exynos5420 SoC.
	- "samsung,exynos5433-usbdrd-phy" - for exynos5433 SoC.
	- "samsung,exynos7-usbdrd-phy" - for exynos7 SoC.
- reg : Register offset and length of USB DRD PHY register set;
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller
- clock-names: names of clocks correseponding to IDs in the clock property;
	       Required clocks:
	- phy: main PHY clock (same as USB DRD controller i.e. DWC3 IP clock),
	       used for register access.
	- ref: PHY's reference clock (usually crystal clock), used for
	       PHY operations, associated by phy name. It is used to
	       determine bit values for clock settings register.
	       For Exynos5420 this is given as 'sclk_usbphy30' in CMU.
	- optional clocks: Exynos5433 & Exynos7 SoC has now following additional
			   gate clocks available:
			   - phy_pipe: for PIPE3 phy
			   - phy_utmi: for UTMI+ phy
			   - itp: for ITP generation
- samsung,pmu-syscon: phandle for PMU system controller interface, used to
		      control pmu registers for power isolation.
- #phy-cells : from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1;

For "samsung,exynos5250-usbdrd-phy" and "samsung,exynos5420-usbdrd-phy"
compatible PHYs, the second cell in the PHY specifier identifies the
PHY id, which is interpreted as follows:
  0 - UTMI+ type phy,
  1 - PIPE3 type phy,

Example:
	usbdrd_phy: usbphy@12100000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-usbdrd-phy";
		reg = <0x12100000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&clock 286>, <&clock 1>;
		clock-names = "phy", "ref";
		samsung,pmu-syscon = <&pmu_system_controller>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
	};

- aliases: For SoCs like Exynos5420 having multiple USB 3.0 DRD PHY controllers,
	   'usbdrd_phy' nodes should have numbered alias in the aliases node,
	   in the form of usbdrdphyN, N = 0, 1... (depending on number of
	   controllers).
Example:
	aliases {
		usbdrdphy0 = &usb3_phy0;
		usbdrdphy1 = &usb3_phy1;
	};
