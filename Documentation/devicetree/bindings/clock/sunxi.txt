Required properties for all clocks:
- reg : shall be the control register address for the clock.
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock(s) phandle for the clock. For
	multiplexed clocks, the list order must match the hardware
	programming order.
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0 except for
	"allwinner,*-gates-clk", "allwinner,sun4i-pll5-clk" and
	"allwinner,sun4i-pll6-clk" where it shall be set to 1
- clock-output-names : shall be the corresponding names of the outputs.
	If the clock module only has one output, the name shall be the
	module name.

Clock consumers should specify the desired clocks they use with a
"clocks" phandle cell. Consumers that are using a gated clock should
provide an additional ID in their clock property. This ID is the
offset of the bit controlling this particular gate in the register.

For example:

osc24M: clk@01c20050 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-osc-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20050 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M_fixed>;
	clock-output-names = "osc24M";
};

pll1: clk@01c20000 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-pll1-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20000 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>;
	clock-output-names = "pll1";
};

pll5: clk@01c20020 {
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-pll5-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20020 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>;
	clock-output-names = "pll5_ddr", "pll5_other";
};

cpu: cpu@01c20054 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-cpu-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20054 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc32k>, <&osc24M>, <&pll1>;
	clock-output-names = "cpu";
};

mmc0_clk: clk@01c20088 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-mod0-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20088 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>, <&pll6 1>, <&pll5 1>;
	clock-output-names = "mmc0";
};
