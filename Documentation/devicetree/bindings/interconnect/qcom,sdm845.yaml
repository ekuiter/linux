description: |
   SDM845 interconnect providers support system bandwidth requirements through
   RPMh hardware accelerators known as Bus Clock Manager (BCM). The provider is
   able to communicate with the BCM through the Resource State Coordinator (RSC)
   associated with each execution environment. Provider nodes must reside within
   an RPMh device node pertaining to their RSC and each provider maps to a
   single RPMh resource.
