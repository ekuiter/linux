* Atmel HW cryptographic accelerators

These are the HW cryptographic accelerators found on some Atmel products.

* Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha".
- reg: Should contain SHA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the SHA.

Optional properties:
- dmas: One DMA specifiers as described in
        atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
- dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
             in the dmas property. Only one "tx" string needed.

Example:
sha@f8034000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha";
	reg = <0xf8034000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <42 4 0>;
	dmas = <&dma1 2 17>;
	dma-names = "tx";
};
