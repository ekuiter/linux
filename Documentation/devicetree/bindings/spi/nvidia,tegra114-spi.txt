Required properties:
- compatible : should be "nvidia,tegra114-spi".
- reg: Should contain SPI registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupts.
- nvidia,dma-request-selector : The Tegra DMA controller's phandle and
  request selector for this SPI controller.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - spi
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - spi

Recommended properties:
- spi-max-frequency: Definition as per
                     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
