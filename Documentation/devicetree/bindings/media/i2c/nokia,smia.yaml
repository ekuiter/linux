description:

  SMIA (Standard Mobile Imaging Architecture) is an image sensor standard
  defined jointly by Nokia and ST. SMIA++, defined by Nokia, is an extension of
  that. These definitions are valid for both types of sensors.

  More detailed documentation can be found in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt .
