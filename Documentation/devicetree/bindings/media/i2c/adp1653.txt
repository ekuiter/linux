* Analog Devices ADP1653 flash LED driver

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must contain be "adi,adp1653"

  - reg: I2C slave address

  - gpios: References to the GPIO that controls the power for the chip.

There are two led outputs available - flash and indicator. One led is
represented by one child node, nodes need to be named "flash" and "indicator".

Required properties of the LED child node:
- max-microamp : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Required properties of the flash LED child node:

- flash-max-microamp : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- flash-timeout-us : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

	adp1653: led-controller@30 {
		compatible = "adi,adp1653";
		reg = <0x30>;
		gpios = <&gpio3 24 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* 88 */

		flash {
			flash-timeout-us = <500000>;
			flash-max-microamp = <320000>;
			max-microamp = <50000>;
		};
		indicator {
			max-microamp = <17500>;
		};
	};
