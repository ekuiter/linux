Driver for ARM AXI Bus with Broadcom Plugins (bcma)

Required properties:

- compatible : brcm,bus-axi

- reg : iomem address range of chipcommon core

The cores on the AXI bus are automatically detected by bcma with the
memory ranges they are using and they get registered afterwards.

Example:

	axi@18000000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bus-axi";
		reg = <0x18000000 0x1000>;
		ranges = <0x00000000 0x18000000 0x00100000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
	};
