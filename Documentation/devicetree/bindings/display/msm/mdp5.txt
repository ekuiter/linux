Qualcomm adreno/snapdragon MDP5 display controller

Description:

This is the bindings documentation for the Mobile Display Subsytem(MDSS) that
encapsulates sub-blocks like MDP5, DSI, HDMI, eDP etc, and the MDP5 display
controller found in SoCs like MSM8974, APQ8084, MSM8916, MSM8994 and MSM8996.

MDSS:
Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdss" - MDSS
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "mdss_phys"
  * "vbif_phys"
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from MDSS.
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- power-domains: a power domain consumer specifier according to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt
- clocks: device clocks. See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required.
  * "iface_clk"
  * "bus_clk"
  * "vsync_clk"
- #address-cells: number of address cells for the MDSS children. Should be 1.
- #size-cells: Should be 1.
- ranges: parent bus address space is the same as the child bus address space.

Optional properties:
- clock-names: the following clocks are optional:
  * "lut_clk"

MDP5:
Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdp5" - MDP5
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "mdp_phys"
- interrupts: Interrupt line from MDP5 to MDSS interrupt controller.
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the MDSS block
  through MDP block
- clocks: device clocks. See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required.
-   * "bus_clk"
-   * "iface_clk"
-   * "core_clk"
-   * "vsync_clk"

Optional properties:
- clock-names: the following clocks are optional:
  * "lut_clk"
