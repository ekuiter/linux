Rockchip PWM controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "rockchip,rk2928-pwm"
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
 - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock
 - #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
   description of the cell format.

Example:

	pwm0: pwm@20030000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk2928-pwm";
		reg = <0x20030000 0x10>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_PWM01>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
	};
