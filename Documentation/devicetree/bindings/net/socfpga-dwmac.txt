Altera SOCFPGA SoC DWMAC controller

The device node has following properties.

Required properties:
 - compatible	: Should contain "altr,socfpga-stmmac"
 - altr,sysmgr-syscon : Should be the phandle to the system manager node that
   encompasses the glue register, and the register offset.

Sub-nodes:
The dwmac core should be added as subnode to SOCFPGA dwmac glue.
- dwmac :	The binding details of dwmac can be found in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt

Example:

ethernet0: ethernet0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	compatible = "altr,socfpga-stmmac";
	altr,sysmgr-syscon = <&sysmgr 0x60>;
	status = "disabled";
	ranges;

	gmac0: gmac0@ff700000 {
		compatible = "snps,dwmac-3.70a", "snps,dwmac";
		reg = <0xff700000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <0 115 4>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq";
		mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];/* Filled in by U-Boot */
		clocks = <&emac0_clk>;
		clock-names = "stmmaceth";
	};
};
