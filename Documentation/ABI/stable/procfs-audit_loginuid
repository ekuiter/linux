KernelVersion:	2.6.11-rc2 1e2d1492e178 ("[PATCH] audit: handle loginuid through proc")
Contact:	linux-audit@redhat.com
Format:		%u
Users:		audit and login applications
Description:
		The /proc/$pid/loginuid pseudofile is written to set and
		read to get the audit login UID of process $pid.  If it is
		unset, permissions are not needed to set it.  The accessor must
		have CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL in the initial user namespace to write
		it if it has been set.  It cannot be written again if
		AUDIT_FEATURE_LOGINUID_IMMUTABLE is enabled.  It cannot be
		unset if AUDIT_FEATURE_ONLY_UNSET_LOGINUID is enabled.
