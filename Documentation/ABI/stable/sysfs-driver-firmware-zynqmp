Description:
		Read/Write PMU global general storage register value,
		GLOBAL_GEN_STORAGE{0:3}.
		Global general storage register that can be used
		by system to pass information between masters.

		The register is reset during system or power-on
		resets. Three registers are used by the FSBL and
		other Xilinx software products: GLOBAL_GEN_STORAGE{4:6}.

		Usage:
		# cat /sys/devices/platform/firmware\:zynqmp-firmware/ggs0
		# echo <value> > /sys/devices/platform/firmware\:zynqmp-firmware/ggs0

		Example:

Description:
		Read/Write PMU persistent global general storage register
		value, PERS_GLOB_GEN_STORAGE{0:3}.
		Persistent global general storage register that
		can be used by system to pass information between
		masters.

		This register is only reset by the power-on reset
		and maintains its value through a system reset.
		Four registers are used by the FSBL and other Xilinx
		software products: PERS_GLOB_GEN_STORAGE{4:7}.
		Register is reset only by a POR reset.

		Usage:
		# cat /sys/devices/platform/firmware\:zynqmp-firmware/pggs0
		# echo <value> > /sys/devices/platform/firmware\:zynqmp-firmware/pggs0

		Example:
		# cat /sys/devices/platform/firmware\:zynqmp-firmware/pggs0
