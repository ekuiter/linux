What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
Date:		June 2022
KernelVersion:	6.0
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) Reports the current state of the QAT device. Write to
		the file to start or stop the device.

		The values are:

		* up: the device is up and running
		* down: the device is down


		It is possible to transition the device from up to down only
		if the device is up and vice versa.

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
Date:		June 2022
KernelVersion:	6.0
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) Reports the current configuration of the QAT device.
		Write to the file to change the configured services.

		The values are:

		* sym;asym: the device is configured for running crypto
		  services
		* asym;sym: identical to sym;asym
		* dc: the device is configured for running compression services
		* sym: the device is configured for running symmetric crypto
		  services
		* asym: the device is configured for running asymmetric crypto
		  services
		* asym;dc: the device is configured for running asymmetric
		  crypto services and compression services
		* dc;asym: identical to asym;dc
		* sym;dc: the device is configured for running symmetric crypto
		  services and compression services
		* dc;sym: identical to sym;dc

		It is possible to set the configuration only if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The following example shows how to change the configuration of
		a device configured for running crypto services in order to
		run data compression::

			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			up
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			sym;asym
			# echo down > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# echo dc > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			# echo up > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			dc

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.
