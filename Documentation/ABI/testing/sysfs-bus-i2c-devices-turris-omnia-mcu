What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<mcu_device>/board_revision
Date:		September 2024
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	Marek Behún <kabel@kernel.org>
Description:	(RO) Contains board revision number.

		Only available if board information is burned in the MCU (older
		revisions have board information burned in the ATSHA204-A chip).

		Format: %u.

What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<mcu_device>/first_mac_address
Date:		September 2024
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	Marek Behún <kabel@kernel.org>
Description:	(RO) Contains device first MAC address. Each Turris Omnia is
		allocated 3 MAC addresses. The two additional addresses are
		computed from the first one by incrementing it.

		Only available if board information is burned in the MCU (older
		revisions have board information burned in the ATSHA204-A chip).

		Format: %pM.

What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<mcu_device>/fw_features
Date:		September 2024
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	Marek Behún <kabel@kernel.org>
Description:	(RO) Newer versions of the microcontroller firmware report the
		features they support. These can be read from this file. If the
		MCU firmware is too old, this file reads 0x0.

		Format: 0x%x.

		reset.

		Format: %i.

What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<mcu_device>/serial_number
Date:		September 2024
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	Marek Behún <kabel@kernel.org>
Description:	(RO) Contains the 64-bit board serial number in hexadecimal
		format.

		Only available if board information is burned in the MCU (older
		revisions have board information burned in the ATSHA204-A chip).

		Format: %016X.
