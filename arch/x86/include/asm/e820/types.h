/*
 * The legacy E820 BIOS limits us to 128 (E820MAX) nodes due to the
 * constrained space in the zeropage.
 *
 * On large systems we can easily have thousands of nodes with RAM,
 * which cannot be fit into so few entries - so we have a mechanism
 * to extend the e820 table size at build-time, via the E820_X_MAX
 * define below.
 *
 * ( Those extra entries are enumerated via the EFI memory map, not
 *   via the legacy zeropage mechanism. )
 *
 * Size our internal memory map tables to have room for these additional
 * entries, based on a heuristic calculation: up to three entries per
 * NUMA node, plus E820MAX for some extra space.
 *
 * This allows for bootstrap/firmware quirks such as possible duplicate
 * E820 entries that might need room in the same arrays, prior to the
 * call to sanitize_e820_map() to remove duplicates.  The allowance
 * of three memory map entries per node is "enough" entries for
 * the initial hardware platform motivating this mechanism to make
 * use of additional EFI map entries.  Future platforms may want
 * to allow more than three entries per node or otherwise refine
 * this size.
