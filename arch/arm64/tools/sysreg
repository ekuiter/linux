# System register metadata

# Each System register is described by a Sysreg block:

# Sysreg 	<name>	<op0> 	<op1>	<crn>	<crm>	<op2>
# <field>
# ...
# EndSysreg

# Within a Sysreg block, each field can be described as one of:

# Res0	<msb>[:<lsb>]

# Res1	<msb>[:<lsb>]

# Field	<msb>[:<lsb>]	<name>

# Enum	<msb>[:<lsb>]	<name>
#	<enumval>	<enumname>
#	...
# EndEnum

# Alternatively if multiple registers share the same layout then
# a SysregFields block can be used to describe the shared layout

# SysregFields	<fieldsname>
# <field>
# ...
# EndSysregFields

# and referenced from within the Sysreg:

# Sysreg 	<name>	<op0> 	<op1>	<crn>	<crm>	<op2>
# Fields	<fieldsname>
# EndSysreg

# For ID registers we adopt a few conventions for translating the
# language in the ARM into defines:
#
# NI  - Not implemented
# IMP - Implemented
#
# In general it is recommended that new enumeration items be named for the
# feature that introduces them (eg, FEAT_LS64_ACCDATA introduces enumeration
# item ACCDATA) though it may be more taseful to do something else.
