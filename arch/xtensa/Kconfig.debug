	help
	  Enable this function to disable link-time optimizations.
	  The default linker behavior is to combine identical literal
	  values to reduce code size and remove unnecessary overhead from
	  assembler-generated 'longcall' sequences.
	  Enabling this option improves the link time but increases the
	  code size, and possibly execution time.
