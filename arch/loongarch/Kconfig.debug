config UNWINDER_GUESS
	bool "Guess unwinder"
	help
	  This option enables the "guess" unwinder for unwinding kernel stack
	  traces.  It scans the stack and reports every kernel text address it
	  finds.  Some of the addresses it reports may be incorrect.

	  While this option often produces false positives, it can still be
	  useful in many cases.
