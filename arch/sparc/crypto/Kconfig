	  Use SPARC64 crypto opcodes for AES algorithm.

	  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael
	  algorithm.

	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing
	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback
	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is
	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well
	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also
	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are
	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.

	  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits

	  See <http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/> for more information.

	  In addition to AES cipher algorithm support, the acceleration
	  for some popular block cipher mode is supported too, including
	  ECB and CBC.

	  Camellia cipher algorithm module (SPARC64).

	  Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher developed jointly
	  at NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

	  The Camellia specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
