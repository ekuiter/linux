	  Use SPARC64 crypto opcodes for AES algorithm.

	  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael
	  algorithm.

	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing
	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback
	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is
	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well
	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also
	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are
	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.

	  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits

	  See <http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/> for more information.

	  In addition to AES cipher algorithm support, the acceleration
	  for some popular block cipher mode is supported too, including
	  ECB and CBC.

	  Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher developed jointly
	  at NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

	  The Camellia specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
