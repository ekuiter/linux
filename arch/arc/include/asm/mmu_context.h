/*		ARC700 ASID Management
 *
 * ARC MMU provides 8-bit ASID (0..255) to TAG TLB entries, allowing entries
 * with same vaddr (different tasks) to co-exit. This provides for
 * "Fast Context Switch" i.e. no TLB flush on ctxt-switch
 *
 * Linux assigns each task a unique ASID. A simple round-robin allocation
 * of H/w ASID is done using software tracker @asid_cache.
 * When it reaches max 255, the allocation cycle starts afresh by flushing
 * the entire TLB and wrapping ASID back to zero.
 *
 * For book-keeping, Linux uses a couple of data-structures:
 *  -mm_struct has an @asid field to keep a note of task's ASID (needed at the
 *   time of say switch_mm( )
 *  -An array of mm structs @asid_mm_map[] for asid->mm the reverse mapping,
 *  given an ASID, finding the mm struct associated.
 *
 * The round-robin allocation algorithm allows for ASID stealing.
 * If asid tracker is at "x-1", a new req will allocate "x", even if "x" was
 * already assigned to another (switched-out) task. Obviously the prev owner
 * is marked with an invalid ASID to make it request for a new ASID when it
 * gets scheduled next time. However its TLB entries (with ASID "x") could
 * exist, which must be cleared before the same ASID is used by the new owner.
 * Flushing them would be plausible but costly solution. Instead we force a
 * allocation policy quirk, which ensures that a stolen ASID won't have any
 * TLB entries associates, alleviating the need to flush.
 * The quirk essentially is not allowing ASID allocated in prev cycle
 * to be used past a roll-over in the next cycle.
 * When this happens (i.e. task ASID > asid tracker), task needs to refresh
 * its ASID, aligning it to current value of tracker. If the task doesn't get
 * scheduled past a roll-over, hence its ASID is not yet realigned with
 * tracker, such ASID is anyways safely reusable because it is
 * gauranteed that TLB entries with that ASID wont exist.
