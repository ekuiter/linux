	---help---
	  MultiProtocol Label Switching routes packets through logical
	  circuits.  Originally conceved as a way of routing packets at
	  hardware speeds (before hardware was capable of routing ipv4 packets),
	  MPLS remains as simple way of making tunnels.

	  If you have not heard of MPLS you probably want to say N here.

if MPLS

config NET_MPLS_GSO
	bool "MPLS: GSO support"
	help
	 This is helper module to allow segmentation of non-MPLS GSO packets
	 that have had MPLS stack entries pushed onto them and thus
	 become MPLS GSO packets.

config MPLS_ROUTING
	bool "MPLS: routing support"
	help
