Linux Ftrace Testcases

This is a collection of testcases for ftrace tracing feature in the Linux
kernel. Since ftrace exports interfaces via the debugfs, we just need
shell scripts for testing. Feel free to add new test cases.

Running the ftrace testcases
============================

At first, you need to be the root user to run this script.
To run all testcases:

  $ sudo ./ftracetest

To run specific testcases:

  # ./ftracetest test.d/basic3.tc

Or you can also run testcases under given directory:

  # ./ftracetest test.d/kprobe/

Contributing new testcases
==========================

Copy test.d/template to your testcase (whose filename must have *.tc
extension) and rewrite the test description line.

 * The working directory of the script is <debugfs>/tracing/.

 * Take care with side effects as the tests are run with root privilege.

 * The tests should not run for a long period of time (more than 1 min.)
   These are to be unit tests.

 * You can add a directory for your testcases under test.d/ if needed.

 * The test cases should run on dash (busybox shell) for testing on
   minimal cross-build environments.

TODO

 * Fancy colored output :)
