perf.data directory format

DISCLAIMER This is not ABI yet and is subject to possible change
           in following versions of perf. We will remove this
           disclaimer once the directory format soaks in.


This document describes the on-disk perf.data directory format.

The layout is described by HEADER_DIR_FORMAT feature.
Currently it holds only version number (0):

  HEADER_DIR_FORMAT = 24

  struct {
     uint64_t version;
  }

The current only version value 0 means that:
  - there is a single perf.data file named 'data' within the directory.
  e.g.

    $ tree -ps perf.data
    perf.data
    └── [-rw-------       25912]  data

Future versions are expected to describe different data files
layout according to special needs.
