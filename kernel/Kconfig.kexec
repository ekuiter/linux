	select KEXEC_CORE
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel. It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware. And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you. As of this writing the exact hardware
	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
	  made.

config KEXEC_FILE
	bool "Enable kexec file based system call"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_FILE
	select KEXEC_CORE
	help
	  This is new version of kexec system call. This system call is
	  file based and takes file descriptors as system call argument
	  for kernel and initramfs as opposed to list of segments as
	  accepted by kexec system call.

config KEXEC_SIG
	bool "Verify kernel signature during kexec_file_load() syscall"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_SIG
	depends on KEXEC_FILE
	help
	  This option makes the kexec_file_load() syscall check for a valid
	  signature of the kernel image. The image can still be loaded without
	  a valid signature unless you also enable KEXEC_SIG_FORCE, though if
	  there's a signature that we can check, then it must be valid.

	  In addition to this option, you need to enable signature
	  verification for the corresponding kernel image type being
	  loaded in order for this to work.

config KEXEC_SIG_FORCE
	bool "Require a valid signature in kexec_file_load() syscall"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_SIG_FORCE
	depends on KEXEC_SIG
	help
	  This option makes kernel signature verification mandatory for
	  the kexec_file_load() syscall.

config KEXEC_IMAGE_VERIFY_SIG
	bool "Enable Image signature verification support (ARM)"
	default ARCH_DEFAULT_KEXEC_IMAGE_VERIFY_SIG
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_IMAGE_VERIFY_SIG
	depends on KEXEC_SIG
	depends on EFI && SIGNED_PE_FILE_VERIFICATION
	help
	  Enable Image signature verification support.

config KEXEC_BZIMAGE_VERIFY_SIG
	bool "Enable bzImage signature verification support"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_BZIMAGE_VERIFY_SIG
	depends on KEXEC_SIG
	depends on SIGNED_PE_FILE_VERIFICATION
	select SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYRING
	help
	  Enable bzImage signature verification support.

config KEXEC_JUMP
	bool "kexec jump"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC_JUMP
	depends on KEXEC && HIBERNATION
	help
	  Jump between original kernel and kexeced kernel and invoke
	  code in physical address mode via KEXEC

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "kernel crash dumps"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_CRASH_DUMP
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_KEXEC
	select CRASH_CORE
	select KEXEC_CORE
	select KEXEC
	help
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using
	  PHYSICAL_START, or it must be built as a relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y).
	  For more details see Documentation/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.rst

	  For s390, this option also enables zfcpdump.
