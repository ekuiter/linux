	  Enable this option to debug the use of the DMA API by device drivers.
	  With this option you will be able to detect common bugs in device
	  drivers like double-freeing of DMA mappings or freeing mappings that
	  were never allocated.

	  This also attempts to catch cases where a page owned by DMA is
	  accessed by the cpu in a way that could cause data corruption.  For
	  example, this enables cow_user_page() to check that the source page is
	  not undergoing DMA.

	  This option causes a performance degradation.  Use only if you want to
	  debug device drivers and dma interactions.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Perform extra checking that callers of dma_map_sg() have respected the
	  appropriate segment length/boundary limits for the given device when
	  preparing DMA scatterlists.

	  This is particularly likely to have been overlooked in cases where the
	  dma_map_sg() API is used for general bulk mapping of pages rather than
	  preparing literal scatter-gather descriptors, where there is a risk of
	  unexpected behaviour from DMA API implementations if the scatterlist
	  is technically out-of-spec.

	  If unsure, say N.
