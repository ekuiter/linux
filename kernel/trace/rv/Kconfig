	  Enable the kernel runtime verification infrastructure. RV is a
	  lightweight (yet rigorous) method that complements classical
	  exhaustive verification techniques (such as model checking and
	  theorem proving). RV works by analyzing the trace of the system's
	  actual execution, comparing it against a formal specification of
	  the system behavior.

config RV_REACTORS
	bool "Runtime verification reactors"
	default y
	depends on RV
	help
	  Enables the online runtime verification reactors. A runtime
	  monitor can cause a reaction to the detection of an exception
	  on the model's execution. By default, the monitors have
	  tracing reactions, printing the monitor output via tracepoints,
	  but other reactions can be added (on-demand) via this interface.
