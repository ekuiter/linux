	  Enable the kernel runtime verification infrastructure. RV is a
	  lightweight (yet rigorous) method that complements classical
	  exhaustive verification techniques (such as model checking and
	  theorem proving). RV works by analyzing the trace of the system's
	  actual execution, comparing it against a formal specification of
	  the system behavior.
