	  Any files read through the kernel file reading interface
	  (kernel modules, firmware, kexec images, security policy) will
	  be pinned to the first filesystem used for loading. Any files
	  that come from other filesystems will be rejected. This is best
	  used on systems without an initrd that have a root filesystem
	  backed by a read-only device such as dm-verity or a CDROM.
