	  The Freescale Data Path Acceleration Architecture (DPAA) is a set of
	  hardware components on specific QorIQ multicore processors.
	  This architecture provides the infrastructure to support simplified
	  sharing of networking interfaces and accelerators by multiple CPUs.
	  The major h/w blocks composing DPAA are BMan and QMan.

	  The Buffer Manager (BMan) is a hardware buffer pool management block
	  that allows software and accelerators on the datapath to acquire and
	  release buffers in order to build frames.

	  The Queue Manager (QMan) is a hardware queue management block
	  that allows software and accelerators on the datapath to enqueue and
	  dequeue frames in order to communicate.
