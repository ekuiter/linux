	  Say Y or M here if your system as an ISP1760 USB host controller
	  or an ISP1761 USB dual-role controller.

	  This driver does not support isochronous transfers or OTG.
	  This USB controller is usually attached to a non-DMA-Master
	  capable bus. NXP's eval kit brings this chip on PCI card
	  where the chip itself is behind a PLB to simulate such
	  a bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called isp1760.

	help
