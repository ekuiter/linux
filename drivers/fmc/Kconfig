	  FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Carrier) is a mechanical and electrical
	  standard for mezzanine cards that plug into a carrier board.
	  This kernel subsystem supports the matching between carrier
	  and mezzanine based on identifiers stored in the internal I2C
	  EEPROM, as well as having carrier-independent drivers.

	  The framework was born outside of the kernel and at this time
	  the off-tree code base is more complete.  Code and documentation
	  is at git://ohwr.org/fmc-projects/fmc-bus.git .
