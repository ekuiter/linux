	  This enables counter device support through the Generic Counter
	  interface. You only need to enable this, if you also want to enable
	  one or more of the counter device drivers below.

if COUNTER

config 104_QUAD_8
	tristate "ACCES 104-QUAD-8 driver"
	depends on PC104 && X86 && IIO
	select ISA_BUS_API
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  A counter's respective error flag may be cleared by performing a write
	  operation on the respective count value attribute. Although the
	  104-QUAD-8 counters have a 25-bit range, only the lower 24 bits may be
	  set, either directly or via the counter's preset attribute. Interrupts
	  are not supported by this driver.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter.
