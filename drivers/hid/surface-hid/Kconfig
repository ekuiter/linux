	  Driver to support integrated HID devices on newer Microsoft Surface
	  models.

	  This driver provides support for the HID transport protocol provided
	  by the Surface Aggregator Module (i.e. the embedded controller) on
	  7th-generation Microsoft Surface devices, i.e. Surface Book 3 and
	  Surface Laptop 3. On those models, it is mainly used to connect the
	  integrated touchpad and keyboard.

	  Say M or Y here, if you want support for integrated HID devices, i.e.
	  integrated touchpad and keyboard, on 7th generation Microsoft Surface
	  models.
