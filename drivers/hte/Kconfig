	  Hardware Timestamping Engine (HTE) Support.

	  Some devices provide a hardware timestamping engine which can
	  timestamp certain device lines/signals in realtime. It comes with a
	  benefit for the applications needing accurate timestamping event with
	  less jitter. This framework provides a generic interface to such HTE
	  providers and consumer devices.

	  If unsure, say no.
