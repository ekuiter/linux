	  The power capping sysfs interface allows kernel subsystems to expose power
	  capping settings to user space in a consistent way.  Usually, it consists
	  of multiple control types that determine which settings may be exposed and
	  power zones representing parts of the system that can be subject to power
	  capping.

	  If you want this code to be compiled in, say Y here.
