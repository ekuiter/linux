	  This extension provides an API for the Intel IPU driver to create
	  connections to cameras that are hidden in the SSDB buffer in ACPI.
	  It can be used to enable support for cameras in detachable / hybrid
	  devices that ship with Windows.

	  Say Y here if your device is a detachable / hybrid laptop that comes
	  with Windows installed by the OEM, for example:

		- Microsoft Surface models (except Surface Pro 3)
		- The Lenovo Miix line (for example the 510, 520, 710 and 720)
		- Dell 7285

	  If in doubt, say N here.
