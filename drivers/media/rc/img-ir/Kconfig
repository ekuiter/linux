config IR_IMG

	help
	   Say Y or M here if you want to use the ImgTec infrared decoder
	   functionality found in SoCs such as TZ1090.

config IR_IMG_RAW
	bool "Raw decoder"
	depends on IR_IMG
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the raw mode driver which passes raw IR signal
	   changes to the IR raw decoders for software decoding. This is much
	   less reliable (due to lack of timestamps) and consumes more
	   processing power than using hardware decode, but can be useful for
	   testing, debug, and to make more protocols available.

config IR_IMG_HW
	bool "Hardware decoder"
	depends on IR_IMG
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the hardware decode driver which decodes the IR
	   signals in hardware. This is more reliable, consumes less processing
	   power since only a single interrupt is received for each scancode,
	   and allows an IR scancode to be used as a wake event.
