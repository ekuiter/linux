	help
	  Intel(R) Trace Hub (TH) is a set of hardware blocks (subdevices) that
	  produce, switch and output trace data from multiple hardware and
	  software sources over several types of trace output ports encoded
	  in System Trace Protocol (MIPI STPv2) and is intended to perform
	  full system debugging.

	  This option enables intel_th bus and common code used by TH
	  subdevices to interact with each other and hardware and for
	  platform glue layers to drive Intel TH devices.

	  Say Y here to enable Intel(R) Trace Hub controller support.

config INTEL_TH_PCI

	help
	  Intel(R) Trace Hub may exist as a PCI device. This option enables
	  support glue layer for PCI-based Intel TH.

	  Say Y here to enable PCI Intel TH support.

	tristate "Intel(R) Trace Hub Global Trace Hub"
	help
	  Global Trace Hub (GTH) is the central component of the
	  Intel TH infrastructure and acts as a switch for source
	  and output devices. This driver is required for other
	  Intel TH subdevices to initialize.

	  Say Y here to enable GTH subdevice of Intel(R) Trace Hub.

config INTEL_TH_DEBUG
	bool "Intel(R) Trace Hub debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debugging.
