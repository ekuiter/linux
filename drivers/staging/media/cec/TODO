TODOs:

- Once this is out of staging this should no longer be a separate
  config option, instead it should be selected by drivers that want it.
- Revisit the IS_REACHABLE(RC_CORE): perhaps the RC_CORE support should
  be enabled through a separate config option in drivers/media/Kconfig
  or rc/Kconfig?
