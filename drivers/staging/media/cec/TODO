TODOs:

- Should CEC_LOG_ADDR_TYPE_SPECIFIC be replaced by TYPE_2ND_TV and TYPE_PROCESSOR?
  And also TYPE_SWITCH and TYPE_CDC_ONLY in addition to the TYPE_UNREGISTERED?
  This should give the framework more information about the device type
  since SPECIFIC and UNREGISTERED give no useful information.
- Once this is out of staging this should no longer be a separate
  config option, instead it should be selected by drivers that want it.
- Revisit the IS_REACHABLE(RC_CORE): perhaps the RC_CORE support should
  be enabled through a separate config option in drivers/media/Kconfig
  or rc/Kconfig?
