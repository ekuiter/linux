The reason why cec.c is still in staging is that I would like
to have a bit more confidence in the uABI. The kABI is fine,
no problem there, but I would like to let the public API mature
a bit.

Once I'm confident that I didn't miss anything then the cec.c source
can move to drivers/media and the linux/cec.h and linux/cec-funcs.h
headers can move to uapi/linux and added to uapi/linux/Kbuild to make
them public.

Hopefully this will happen later in 2016.

Other TODOs:

- Add a flag to inhibit passing CEC RC messages to the rc subsystem.
  Applications should be able to choose this when calling S_LOG_ADDRS.
- Convert cec.txt to sphinx.
- If the reply field of cec_msg is set then when the reply arrives it
  is only sent to the filehandle that transmitted the original message
  and not to any followers. Should this behavior change or perhaps
  controlled through a cec_msg flag?
- Should CEC_LOG_ADDR_TYPE_SPECIFIC be replaced by TYPE_2ND_TV and TYPE_PROCESSOR?
  And also TYPE_SWITCH and TYPE_CDC_ONLY in addition to the TYPE_UNREGISTERED?
  This should give the framework more information about the device type
  since SPECIFIC and UNREGISTERED give no useful information.
