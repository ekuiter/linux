Todo:
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups
	- sparse cleanups
	- lots of little modules, should be merged together
	  and added to the build.
	- testing?
	- handle churn in v4l layer.
	- Some features for wis-tw2804 subdev control (comb filter,motion detector sensitive & mask,more over...)
	- go7007-v4l2.c need rewrite with new v4l2 style without nonstandart IO controls (set detector & bitrate)

05/05/2012 3.4.0-rc+:
Changes:
  - When go7007 reset device, i2c was not worked (need rewrite GPIO5)
  - As wis2804 has i2c_addr=0x00/*really*/, so Need set I2C_CLIENT_TEN flag for validity
  - Some main nonzero initialization, rewrites with kzalloc instead kmalloc
  - STATUS_SHUTDOWN was placed in incorrect place, so if firmware wasn`t loaded, we
    failed v4l2_device_unregister with kernel panic (OOPS)
  - Some new v4l2 style features as call_all(...s_stream...) for using subdev calls
  - wis-tw2804.ko module code was incompatible with 3.4.x branch in initialization v4l2_subdev parts.
    now i2c_get_clientdata(...) contains v4l2_subdev struct instead non standart wis_tw2804 struct

Adds:
  - Additional chipset wis2804 controls with: gain,auto gain,inputs[0,1],color kill,chroma gain,gain balances,
    for all 4 channels (from tw2804.pdf)
  - Power control for each 4 ADC up when s_stream(...,1), down otherwise in wis-tw2804 module
