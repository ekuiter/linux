This is a list of things that need to be done to get this driver out of the
staging directory.
- Document sysfs files with Documentation/ABI/ entries.
- Use misc interface instead of major number for driver version description.
- Add descriptions of module_param's
- apex_get_status() should actually check status.
- Fix multi-line alignment formatting to look like:
      int ret = long_function_name(device, VARIABLE1, VARIABLE2,
                                   VARIABLE3, VARIABLE4);
- "drivers" should never be dealing with "raw" sysfs calls or mess around with
  kobjects at all. The driver core should handle all of this for you
  automaically. There should not be a need for raw attribute macros.
