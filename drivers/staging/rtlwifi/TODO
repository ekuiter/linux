TODO:
- checkpatch.pl fixes - most of the remaining ones are lines too long. Many
  of them will require refactoring
- merge Realtek's bugfixes and new features into the driver
- find and remove code blocks guarded by never set CONFIG_FOO defines
- convert any remaining unusual variable types
- find codes that can use %pM and %Nph formatting
- fix any reviewer's comments regarding movin the driver to drivers/net/wireless

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
