Introduction
============

These drivers add support for IndustryPack devices: carrier and mezzanine
boards.

The ipack driver is just an abstraction of the bus providing the common
operations between the two kind of boards.

* The structures and API exported can be improved a lot. For example, the
  way to unregistering mezzanine devices, doing the mezzanine driver a call to
  remove_device() to notify the carrier driver, or the opposite with the call to
  the ipack_driver_ops' remove() function could be improved.
