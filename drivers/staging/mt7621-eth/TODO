- verify devicetree documentation is consistent with code
- fix ethtool - currently doesn't return valid data.
- general code review and clean up
- add support for second MAC on mt7621
- convert gsw code to use switchdev interfaces
- md7620_mmi_write etc should probably be wrapped
  in a regmap abstraction.
