	  Say Y here to enable support for the CPR hardware found on Qualcomm
	  SoCs like QCS404.

	  This driver populates CPU OPPs tables and makes adjustments to the
	  tables based on feedback from the CPR hardware. If you want to do
	  CPUfrequency scaling say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called qcom-cpr
