	  The Platform Environment Control Interface (PECI) is an interface
	  that provides a communication channel to Intel processors and
	  chipset components from external monitoring or control devices.

	  If you are building a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) kernel
	  for Intel platform say Y here and also to the specific driver for
	  your adapter(s) below. If unsure say N.

	  This support is also available as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci.
