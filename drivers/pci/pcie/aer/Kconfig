	  This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting
	  (AER) driver support. Error reporting messages sent to Root
	  Port will be handled by PCI Express AER driver.

	default n
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting
	  (AER) software error injector.

	  Debugging PCIe AER code is quite difficult because it is hard
	  to trigger various real hardware errors. Software based
	  error injection can fake almost all kinds of errors with the
	  help of a user space helper tool aer-inject, which can be
	  gotten from:

	  Used to override firmware/bios settings for PCI Express ECRC
	  (transaction layer end-to-end CRC checking).

	  When in doubt, say N.
