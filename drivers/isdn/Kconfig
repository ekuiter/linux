	  ISDN ("Integrated Services Digital Network", called RNIS in France)
	  is a fully digital telephone service that can be used for voice and
	  data connections.  If your computer is equipped with an ISDN
	  adapter you can use it to connect to your Internet service provider
	  (with SLIP or PPP) faster than via a conventional telephone modem
	  (though still much slower than with DSL) or to make and accept
	  voice calls (eg. turning your PC into a software answering machine
	  or PABX).

	  Select this option if you want your kernel to support ISDN.

menuconfig ISDN_CAPI

	help
	  This provides CAPI (the Common ISDN Application Programming
	  Interface) Version 2.0, a standard making it easy for programs to
	  access ISDN hardware in a device independent way. (For details see
	  <http://www.capi.org/>.)  CAPI supports making and accepting voice
	  and data connections, controlling call options and protocols,
	  as well as ISDN supplementary services like call forwarding or
	  three-party conferences (if supported by the specific hardware
	  driver).

	  Select this option and the appropriate hardware driver below if
	  you have an ISDN adapter supported by the CAPI subsystem.
