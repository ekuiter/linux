 * ACPI event handling for Wilco Embedded Controller
 *
 * Copyright 2019 Google LLC
 *
 * The Wilco Embedded Controller can create custom events that
 * are not handled as standard ACPI objects. These events can
 * contain information about changes in EC controlled features,
 * such as errors and events in the dock or display. For example,
 * an event is triggered if the dock is plugged into a display
 * incorrectly. These events are needed for telemetry and
 * diagnostics reasons, and for possibly alerting the user.

 * These events are triggered by the EC with an ACPI Notify(0x90),
 * and then the BIOS reads the event buffer from EC RAM via an
 * ACPI method. When the OS receives these events via ACPI,
 * it passes them along to this driver. The events are put into
 * a queue which can be read by a userspace daemon via a char device
 * that implements read() and poll(). The event queue acts as a
 * circular buffer of size 64, so if there are no userspace consumers
 * the kernel will not run out of memory. The char device will appear at
 * /dev/wilco_event{n}, where n is some small non-negative integer,
 * starting from 0. Standard ACPI events such as the battery getting
 * plugged/unplugged can also come through this path, but they are
 * dealt with via other paths, and are ignored here.

 * To test, you can tail the binary data with
 * $ cat /dev/wilco_event0 | hexdump -ve '1/1 "%x\n"'
 * and then create an event by plugging/unplugging the battery.
