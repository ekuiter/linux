menuconfig CZNIC_PLATFORMS
	bool "Platform support for CZ.NIC's Turris hardware"
	help
	  Say Y here to be able to choose driver support for CZ.NIC's Turris
	  devices. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

if CZNIC_PLATFORMS

config TURRIS_OMNIA_MCU
	tristate "Turris Omnia MCU driver"
	depends on MACH_ARMADA_38X || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on I2C
	depends on OF
	depends on GPIOLIB
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	select GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for the features implemented by the
	  microcontroller on the CZ.NIC's Turris Omnia SOHO router.
	  The features include:
	  - board poweroff into true low power mode (with voltage regulators
	    disabled) and the ability to configure wake up from this mode (via
	    rtcwake)
	  - GPIO pins
	    - to get front button press events (the front button can be
	      configured either to generate press events to the CPU or to change
	      front LEDs panel brightness)
	    - to enable / disable USB port voltage regulators and to detect
	      USB overcurrent
	    - to detect MiniPCIe / mSATA card presence in MiniPCIe port 0
	    - to configure resets of various peripherals on board revisions 32+
	    - to enable / disable the VHV voltage regulator to the SOC in order
	      to be able to program SOC's OTP on board revisions 32+
	    - to get input from the LED output pins of the WAN ethernet PHY, LAN
	      switch and MiniPCIe ports
	  Other features can be enabled by subsequent config options.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module will be
	  called turris-omnia-mcu.

config TURRIS_OMNIA_MCU_WATCHDOG
	bool "Turris Omnia MCU watchdog"
	default y
	depends on WATCHDOG
	select WATCHDOG_CORE
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for watchdog provided by CZ.NIC's Turris
	  Omnia MCU.

config TURRIS_OMNIA_MCU_TRNG
	bool "Turris Omnia MCU true random number generator"
	default y
	depends on HW_RANDOM
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for the true random number generator
	  provided by CZ.NIC's Turris Omnia MCU.
