	  This driver add support for the INT33FE ACPI device found on the
	  GPD win and the GPD pocket.

	  The INT33FE ACPI device on these mini laptops contains I2cSerialBusV2
	  resources for a MAX17042 Fuel Gauge, FUSB302 USB Type-C Controller
	  and PI3USB30532 USB switch.
	  This driver instantiates i2c-clients for these, so that standard
	  i2c drivers for these chips can bind to the them.

	  If you enable this driver it is advised to also select
	  CONFIG_TYPEC_FUSB302=m, CONFIG_TYPEC_MUX_PI3USB30532=m and
	  CONFIG_BATTERY_MAX17042=m.
