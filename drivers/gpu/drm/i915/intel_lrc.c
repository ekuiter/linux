 * GEN8 brings an expansion of the HW contexts: "Logical Ring Contexts".
 * These expanded contexts enable a number of new abilities, especially
 * "Execlists" (also implemented in this file).
 *
 * Execlists are the new method by which, on gen8+ hardware, workloads are
 * submitted for execution (as opposed to the legacy, ringbuffer-based, method).
